# This config file was created 2018-02-26 02:57:10.350625 by the update_ini script
# The original config files may be found in the /home/cnc/linuxcnc/configs/hacklab-engraver/hacklab-engraver3.old directory

# Generated by stepconf at Sun Mar  8 21:32:59 2009
# Do not run stepconf again

# Modified Sun January 10, 2016 upon axis upgrade

#See http://linuxcnc.org/docs/2.7/html/config/ini-config.html

#Note: Maximum velocity and acceleration appear in 5 sections:
#[DISPLAY], [TRAJ], [AXIS1], [AXIS2], and [AXIS8]
#Display is for the AXIS UI config.
#Traj (Trajectory) is for coordination between all the axes
#Each individual axis has its own configuration as well.

#WILL: TODO
#1. Verify pinouts and maximum step rates with oscilloscope
#2. Connect hardware. Configure currents and microstepping
#2.5 Verify W axis limit switch (positive vs negative) and sign (inverted or not)
#3. Test axes scaling and direction. Set axes velocity and acceleration
#4. Test homing at slow speeds
#5. Optimize home speed - measure axes limit overrun distances and record.
#6. Test for skipped steps with indicators
